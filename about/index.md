### About 

Programming in Java was the first experience I had with a more robust programming language (previously dabled in Auto Hot Key and macro's).
We used Java four  years in College, and we spent months on CUDA with C++. Additional langauges we 
spent time with included: python, lisp, php, mips. I have always wanted to learn 
Ruby as it looks like a great langauge to code in. Recently I've read *Programming in Scala*, and I really enjoy the Scala language.

Creating web crawling programs has been an interest of mine. There is the <a href="https://github.com/Hugo-Riggs/ImgurSpider" target="_blank">imgur dot com crawler (Java,Jsoup)</a>, which works
well with gifs and other types of images, and I modified it to work on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imgurdirectorydownloader&hl=en" target="_blank">android and released a version</a>
on the google store; there is also a more general, scala webspider. Adding GUI's to an application based on the programs is something I try to practice. *Robo* is a fast passed combat-platformer side-scroller in C#.
