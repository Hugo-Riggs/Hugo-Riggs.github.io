#### About

Programming in Java was the first experience I had with a more robust programming language (previously dabled in Auto Hot Key and macro's).
The computer science students used Java four years in College, and we spent months on CUDA with C++. Additional langauges we
spent time with included: python, lisp, php, mips. I have always wanted to learn
Ruby as it looks like a great langauge to code in. Recently I've read *Programming in Scala*, and I really enjoy the Scala language.

Over the past several years I have commited several repositories, and I am constantly improving on them in various ways. Creating web crawling programs has been an interest of mine. There is the

<i>Imgur</i> dot com crawler</a>, duplicated on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imgurdirectorydownloader&hl=en" target="_blank">android</a>. The write once deploy anywhere, Java approach is a powerful attribute of the language. The gui webspider is a scala/sbt project. *Robo* is a fast passed combat-platformer side-scroller in C#.
