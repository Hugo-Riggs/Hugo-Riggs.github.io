<p>Programming in Java was the first experience I had with a more robust programming language.
We used Java all 4 years of College, and we spent months on CUDA with C++. Less stressed
during those years were langauges such as Python and lisp. I have always wanted to learn 
Ruby as it looks like a great langauge to code in. Instead of picking up  a Ruby book, recently
I bought Programming in Scala. Scala which at first looked daunting through the various
example code I found online, has become a very familiar langauge to me, it’s complexities at least
partially unwraveled to my understanding.</p>

<p>I started programming macro’s through Logitech product software drivers, 
and these included the Logitech G500 mouse drivers, as well as the G510
and G502. These macro’s were short and relied on sleep events and button
press events to send specific sequences of timed key strokes, these types of 
macro are useful for manipulating software, and video games for increased
ease of use through automation. I also translated these macro to
(AHK) Auto Hot Key, AHK is a very useful scripting language for Windows OS GUI interaction.</p>

<p>Building prototypes of web crawling software has been alot of my focus. There is the imgur dot com crawler (Java,Jsoup)[TODO: PROVIDE SOURCE], which works
well with gifs and other types of images, and I modified it to work on android and released a version
on the google store. There is a spider I built about a year and a half later (Scala, Jsoup).
The second spider is much more general and not restricted to imgur dot com, furthermore it has
additional capabilities besides downloading media, it can be used to detect broken links on your website.</p>

<p>There is a game “robo” which started in Senior year of College with four people including myself.
It is a C# game with Unity engine and it features 2.5-D gameplay, with weapons and platform mechanics.
The cuda programming is related to my GPUBIP repository, which was my only C++ repository and I enjoyed
using the language very much. Although I am sticking to languages I find faster to program in right now
(Scala) I would not shirk away from the opportunity to work with C++.
The GPUBIP program is based off of a thesis paper in which descriptions of 
the detectable differences in (FD)fractal dimension between different types of biofilm growth patterns are
observed. It is a conclusion that hints at yet another [TODO: PROVIDE SOURCE] practical application of fractal measure, and
the program should return a result between 1 and 2 of an analyzed image, while also outputing
a black and white image, the contour of the original image.</p>
